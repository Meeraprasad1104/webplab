		Web technology: refers to the means by which computers communicate with each other using markup languages and multimedia packages. It gives us a way to interact with hosted information, like websites. Web technology involves the use of hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets <br><br>

Web technologies are the various tools and techniques that are utilised in the process of communication between different types of devices over the internet.<br><br>

To understand this term in a better manner, let’s break it down into two pieces: ‘web’ and ‘technology’.
The web, in this case, refers to the World Wide Web, more commonly known as WWW. It first came into being in 1989 when famous scientist and engineer, Tim Berners-Lee, came up with an efficient mechanism to share resources between scientists all over the world.<br><br>

	Web Programming:

 Learning Web Technology is essential today because Internet has become the number one source to information, and many of the traditional software applications have become Web Applications. Web Applications have become more powerfull and can fully replace desktop application in most situations.
Thats why you need to know basic Web Programming, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To create more powerful Web Sites and Web Applications you also need to know about Web Servers, Database Systems and Web Frameworks like PHP, ASP.NET, etc.<br><br><br>

It all started with Internet (1960s) and the World Wide Web - WWW (1991). The first Web Browser, Netscape, came in 1994. This was the beggining of a new era, where everything is connected on internet, the socalled Internet of Things (IoT).<br><BR>

To create a typical web page you need to combine 3 languages:<br>
HTML - The language for building web pages<br>
CSS - The language for styling web pages<br>
JavaScript - The language for programming web pages<br><br><br>

	frontend/backend:

Two keywords to understand how websites work you might have heard before are the frontend and the backend. These are often talked about (and taught) separately and seen as two very different things, but they are both essential and closely connected in most web development projects.<br><br>

The front end, also called “client-side” programming, is what happens in the browser. It’s everything the user sees and interacts with.<br><br>

	<ol ><u>The Basics of Front-End Tools & Technology</u></ol>
	<li>HTML: The Organizer
HTML is how every site on the web is organized, so it’s a big one you can’t live without in front-end development.
HTML5 is the latest HTML specification. Get a full run-down of this evolving backbone of front-end web technology and learn about one of its cooler features, Canvas.</li><br><br>

	<li>JavaScript: The Multitasker
What was once a supplementary tool to make web pages more interactive is now the most ubiquitous client-side technology. JavaScript is more than just a language — it’s an entire ecosystem that spans frameworks, task runners, server-side development, and more.</li><BR><BR>

	<li>CSS: The Stylist
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is how developers add styling and effects to a website. Styles can be added globally, then layered on without changing that fundamental styling that gets applied to a whole site.<br>

CSS is always evolving. Get to know what’s new with the latest and greatest version, CSS3.
Many front-end developers use a CSS preprocessor to make writing lots of lines of CSS even faster.
CSS front-end frameworks like Foundation or Bootstrap can help you create polished websites in a snap.</li></ol><br><br>.


		<a name="frame"></a>
		<h2 align="center"><u><i>frame works</i></u></h2>
		 <center>
        	 <img src="frame.jpg" style="width:30%" height:"40%" ></center><br><br><br>

	
	Frame works:
A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.<br><br>

	1. Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on Rails is an extremely productive web application framework written by David Heinemeier Hansson. One can develop an application at least ten times faster with Rails than a typical Java framework. Moreover, Rails includes everything needed to create a database-driven web application, using the Model-View-Controller pattern.<br><br>

	2. Django:
Django is another framework that helps in building quality web applications. It was invented to meet fast-moving newsroom deadlines while satisfying the tough requirements of experienced Web developers. Django developers say the applications are it’s ridiculously fast, secure, scalable, and versatile.<br><br>


	3. Angular(Also, know as Angular JS):
Angular is a framework by Google (originally developed by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons) which helps us in building powerful Web Apps. It is a framework to build large scale and high-performance web applications while keeping them as easy-to-maintain. There are a huge number of web apps that are built with Angular.<br><br>

	4. ASP.NET:
ASP.NET is a framework developed by Microsoft, which helps us to build robust web applications for PC, as well as mobile devices. It is a high performance and lightweight framework for building Web Applications using .NET. All in all, a framework with Power, Productivity, and Speed.<br><br>

	5. Express:
Express or Expressjs is a minimal and flexible framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is relatively minimal meaning many features are available as plugins. Express facilitates the rapid development of Node.js based Web applications. Express is also one major component of the MEAN software bundle.<br><br>
	
	
		<a name="Data formats"></a>
		<h2 align="center"><u><i>Data formats</i></u></h2>
		<center>
        	 <img src="dataformat.jpg" style="width:30%" height="40%" ></center><br><br><br>

	
	Data Formats:
Whenever there is a need to exchange data between two devices on the web, a proper procedure is followed. Data is packaged properly for transmission from the source to the destination. Special APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are designed and integrated into websites for convenient data exchange. They arrange the data in such a way that the receiver can easily decode and understand it.<br><br>

Below are two common data formats used in web development.<br><br>

1. XML:
 stands for Extensible Markup Language. We discussed the syntax for HTML at the beginning of this article. XML operates in a similar manner in that it breaks down data into elements identified by various types of tags. However, with XML, you can invent your own tags to describe your data better. This data, upon reaching a web app or server, can be easily understood and analysed.<br><br>

Here, the main or root node is student. student name, year, and courses are child nodes. You could say that these are attributes of the root node. As is the case with HTML, XML data is also written between the opening and closing tags of the child nodes.<br><br>

2. JSON:
After years of experiencing XML’s bulkiness and heavy consumption of bandwidth, experts came up with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Unlike XML, JSON focuses more on quick and easy data exchange rather than detailed data definition and modelling. It also eliminates all the extra load that XML carries in the form of repetitive tags.<br><br>

JSON is based on the familiar key-value pair mechanism. Its syntax resembles that of JavaScript, making it quite easy to read and understand.<br><br>

		<h2 align="center"><u><i>Protocols</i></u></h2>
		<center>
        	 <img src="protocol.jpg" style="width:30%" height="40%" ></center><br><br><br>
	

		Protocols:
Common Internet protocols include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), UDP/IP (User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).<br><br>

TCP/IP:
TCP/IP is a stream protocol. This means that a connection is negotiated between a client and a server. Any data transmitted between these two endpoints is guaranteed to arrive, thus it is a so-called lossless protocol. Since the TCP protocol (as it is also referred to in short form) can only connect two endpoints, it is also called a peer-to-peer protocol.<br><br>

HTTP:
HTTP is the protocol used to transmit all data present on the World Wide Web. This includes text, multimedia and graphics. It is the protocol used to transmit HTML, the language that makes all the fancy decorations in your browser. It works upon TCP/IP.<br><br>

FTP:
FTP is the protocol used to transmit files between computers connected to each other by a TCP/IP network, such as the Internet.<br><br>



		<a name="Database"></a>
		<h2 align="center"><u><i>Database</i></u></h2>
		<center>
        	<img src="database.jpg" style="width:30%" height="40%" ></center><br><br><br>
	
		Databases:
All the data that is exchanged on the web needs to be stored somewhere. For this purpose, most websites have their own databases associated with them.<br><br>

Below is a list of some databases – some relational and others, non-relational – that are commonly used for web applications.<br><br>

1.MySQL<br>
2.SQL Server<br>
3.Postgres<br>
4.Oracle<br>
5.MongoDB<br>
6.Redis<br>



		<a name="future"></a>
		<h2 align="center"><u><i>Future enhacement</i></u></h2>

		The Future Of Web Technologies:
A report by Cisco predicts that almost 52% of the world’s population will have access to the internet by the year 2020. The World Wide Web will grow at astonishing rates to include a higher number of people, devices, and resources available online. Therefore, web technologies are expected to scale up. Consequently, tech professionals will strive harder to provide accessible web content to users everywhere. Tougher security measures will have to be taken to protect private web content from malicious cyberattacks.<br><br>

The WWW started as Web 1.0 with static web pages written in plain old HTML. It then moved on to Web 2.0 with the advent of JavaScript and other technologies that enabled users to interact with web content and produce their own.<br><br>

Soon, the Web will go a step further and enter its third phase, i.e. Web 3.0, which will be far more decentralised than it is today. Modern technologies such as AI and IoT will soon dominate the Web. Everything will be much more automated in terms of both development and consumption of new content.<br><br>

We hope that this article helped you gain some valuable insights into the evolution and future of web technologies. Keep following our blog to stay updated on other interesting developments in the WWW landscape!<br><br>
